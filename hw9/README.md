You are free to decide which idioms to use and how interactions to provide in your system. There are no rules in this homework. The grading depends on how much information your system can reveal. Accordingly, in addition to submitting your codes, you have to write a short report describing the story in the dataset.

- PS1: Given the complexity, you have 3 weeks to implement this homework. However, please start the implementation as early as possible. Otherwise, you will fail.

- PS2: You can choose other libraries rather than D3. But please make sure your vis system is a web-based tool.

- PS3: Name your page by "your_student_ID.html" or "your_student_ID.js" and upload them to the server we provide. The links for uploading your homework will be announced soon. Note that you also have to upload your codes and report to E3.
