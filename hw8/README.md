# Sankey Diagram

## Objective

Craft a Sankey Diagram to represent car evaluation data using D3.

- Example code: [https://d3-graph-gallery.com/sankey.html](https://d3-graph-gallery.com/sankey.html)

- Data Source: [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/19/car+evaluation](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/19/car+evaluation)

## Requirements

- Data Preparation: Preprocess the data, ensuring you have valid pairings between attributes for the Sankey Diagram. This might involve calculating frequency counts for each category combination across the mentioned attributes.

- Sankey Diagram Creation: Display relationships between the categorical attributes: buying, maintenance, doors, persons, luggage boot, and safety. Ensure that the width of the bands in the Sankey Diagram represents the proportion or count of the dataset that holds that relationship.

## Design & Interactivity

- Draggable Nodes: Users should be able to rearrange the Sankey nodes to declutter the view or focus on specific relationships.

- Tooltips: Implement interactive tooltips that show ratios or raw counts when users hover over the bands in the Sankey diagram.

- Visual Design: Ensure a clear color distinction for different categories, and provide a legend or key that explains any color or symbol used.
