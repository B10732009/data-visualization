# Horizon Chart

## Objective

Craft a horizon chart to represent air pollution data using D3.

- Example code: [https://observablehq.com/@d3/horizon-chart](https://observablehq.com/@d3/horizon-chart)

- Data Source: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bappekim/air-pollution-in-seoul](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bappekim/air-pollution-in-seoul)

- Districts & Pollutants: There are 25 districts in Seoul, and data is available for 6 different pollutants. This necessitates the creation of 150 horizon charts.

- Data Period: The dataset covers hourly readings from 2017 through 2019. For this assignment, you should let users focus solely on data from a specific year.

## Requirements

- Data Preparation: Aggregate hourly data into daily summaries. You can use the mean, median, or another appropriate measure as a representative value for each day.

- Horizon Chart Creation: Develop a horizon chart for each combination of district and pollutant, resulting in 150 charts. Ensure clear labeling for each chart indicating the district and pollutant it represents.

- Color Variations: Use distinguishable colors for different pollutants to provide clear visual differentiation.

- Layout: Organize charts in a grid or another systematic arrangement, ensuring easy comparison and identification.

- Interactivity (optional): Add features like tooltips for detailed daily values or zoom capabilities to focus on specific periods.

## Submission

Ensure your code is well-commented and organized. Include any necessary documentation or user guides that can assist in understanding and navigating your visualization.
